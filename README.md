# About me

- I'm currently back at Zalando, working in Fulfillment Core on order fulfillment, delivery time prediction, stock management and related topics.
- Previously consulted companies around strategic, technical, and cultural challenges to putting ML into practice. I still have limited capacity, if you're interested in working with me, best way is to connect on Linkedin and ping me there.
- Previously worked at GetYourGuide as Staff Data Scientist, and at Zalando as Delivery Lead and Principal Research Engineer.
- I spent a lot of time in Machine Learning research at University of Bonn, Fraunhofer, and TU Berlin. [Here are my publications](http://mikiobraun.de/publications.html).
